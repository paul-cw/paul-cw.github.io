### Goal
Hi, Paul here. I started writing this blog to help everyone who is on a journey to become a machine learning master. 

### My story
I am a trained physicist and work in the cross section of research and application of machine learning and part time as trainer for Machine Learning topics. I am especially interested in NLP and various applications of artificial intelligence as well as helping others with the knowledge I have acquired ;-)
